          p Hello! I am a programmer and Computer Science student currently building up my skills in hopes of becoming a web developer. As COVID-19 has greatly impacted the of the world, I became disatisfied with the state of my education. Rather than spending thousands of dollars on a couple of YouTube videos and a diluted education, I decided to take maters into my own hands and joined the Team Treehouse Tech Degree program to make substatial progress in learning web development fundamentals that will help my professional career. 
          p I am intrested in becoming a front-end developer in an environment where I can further hone my experties with help from my seniors. I hope that my work catches your eye and that we can meet in the near future. Feel free to contact me by phone or email at any time, and I would like to extend my gratitude for taking the time to review my works.
